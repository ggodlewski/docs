Contributing to this documentation





1. The source of truth is hosted [HERE](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nwb2j9w6LFZASdr3ouUXPmouw4tynHv-) with a git repository of older versions [here](https://github.mieweb.com/webchart/docs/).
2. Editing documents does not update the live site until the pages are converted from GoogleDocs to Markdown using [wikiGDrive](https://github.com/mieweb/wikiGDrive).
3. The table of contents (TOC) is here and is <strong>not</strong> automatically updated.  If you add pages and want them in the TOC, update this [page](.navigation.html).
4. Macros are used throughout the drive to help maintain multiple brands for the documentation.  







Example macros:

This resolves to the system name/brand: {{% system-name %}}



This is a conditional content in the page.  

{{% only sys="eh" %}}

{{% /only %}}
