The restriction management function provides for the recording and documenting of restrictions (both personal as well as work-related) when working in charts. Personnel may initiate an encounter to document and authorize work restrictions. The types of clinical restrictions choices available for staff to document, when working in charts, is customizable for the {{% system-name %}} system.

From the Control sidemenu tab, find and click the Restrictions Type tab.  A list of all clinical restriction types that are offered will display on the screen in alphabetical order.

In order to access, view, add, edit or delete clinical restriction types that an {{% system-name %}} system will offer, one must have security permission to Manage Clinical Restriction Types.

## Add New Restriction Type(s)

Restriction Types can be added to the system for users to be able to select and document when working in a chart.  First it is important to look through the list of existing clinical restriction types the system currently offers. If a new restriction type needs added to the library of the system, simply click Add Type link found at the top right.



![](../../external_files/6a43a4daa5380f408eb7f9f1e2371124.png)



The Add Clinical Restriction Type fields will display towards the top of the list view.  



![](../../external_files/07c86bd72c5d7e0d4fe259b5c8d0c5b9.png)



In the description field, type in the name of the new restriction type.  Then click the Set Options button under the description field of the new restriction type being added to the system.

A new pop-up displays to allow you to select the format of the new restriction type.  



![](../../external_files/3f1c4d3d5376025deb356634160e2698.png)



* Option Type field offers two types to select from:
    * Discrete Value: if selected, it will allow users to free text restriction details when the main restriction type is documented in a chart.
    * Selected Values: if selected, it will offer users a drop-down of specific restriction details for the main restriction type being added to the system.  When the new restriction type is documented in a chart, another discrete list of choices regarding the restriction type will appear for users to select a more granular value for the restriction.

### Entering a Discrete Value

If Discrete Value is selected as the option type for the new restriction type, it will indicate to offer a free-text discrete field for the user to key in more details related to the restriction type.  The free-text field on the front end will display with a label. Thus, the Label field will display here in the editor for you to type in a label for the discrete value field to be offered. This will be a discrete data field labeled for the restriction details when documented in a chart for the new restriction type.  Meaning, users will be prompted to enter in something about that restriction which will display the additional field with the label you specify here in the editor.



![](../../external_files/9082255f65a1cde9ef7c193738cccf97.png)



Click Save to add the new restriction type and discrete value label to the system library.



![](../../external_files/f60288dbdc5f26619048c2bf6d97e480.png)



The system will display a message that the restriction type has been successfully added.

When users are working in an encounter and documenting restrictions, the new restriction type will be offered as a selection for type, along with a free-text discrete value field displaying the ‘label' indicated.



![](../../external_files/b8dae68571a15989b6b5a9803212a5fb.png)



### Entering a Selected Value

If Selected Value is selected as the option type for the new restriction type, it will indicate to templated discrete value selections for the user to key in more details related to the restriction type.  



After choosing Selected Values as the option type on the new restriction being added to the system, the Values field will display.  Each value line item is where you type in specific value drop-down choices for the staff to utilize on this restriction type.  In the Values field, enter one option at a time to be made available to users.  Then click the + to enter in another value option to appear in the drop-down to be offered to staff when documenting restrictions in a chart.  Enter in as many necessary one at a time using the + button to add another.



![](../../external_files/c04ca96029db63f45a55c7a663ef0c2e.png)



Click Save to add the new restriction type and corresponding selected values to the system library.  The system will display a message that the restriction type has been successfully added.



When users are working in an encounter and documenting restrictions, the new restriction type will be offered as a selection for type, along with another granular list of choices to select a value for the restriction type instead of a free text.

#### Allowed Weight checkbox

In either option type (when adding a new restriction type to the system library) you will see the Allowed Weight field checkbox in the editor.



![](../../external_files/21931c559b69c82635d94abb734e319a.png)



If Allowed Weight is checkmarked, for the new restriction type being added to the system, it will indicate to display a drop-down field titled Allowed Weight on Restriction when documenting restrictions in a chart.

{{% note %}}

In order for the system to show this allowed weight drop-down in the Restrictions section of encounters (even if checkmarked), the system setting I&I, Clinical Restrictions, Use Allowed Weight must be enabled.  Otherwise even if you checkmark this box in the restriction type editor, the system still will not show that featured drop-down if the system setting isn't enabled.

{{% /note %}}


Here is an example of the Allowed weight checkmarked for the restriction type ‘Lifting' and with the system setting enabled:

1. When documenting a restriction for a chart, you would key in the type of restriction.  This is an auto-complete list of restriction types configured in the Restriction Types editor of the system library.
2. Depending if the restriction type is set to offer discrete or selected values, a second field will appear to select the value choices for the restriction. In this example, the Lifting restriction type is configured to offer a templated selected values.

3. It is here, after selecting a selected value, that a 3rd field would open to display specific increments of allowed weight if the restriction type was set to allow weight (the checkbox in the editor) and if the system has the setting enabled to use allowed weight.  ![](../../external_files/82e4637c09ee01d45bc471805c6933bc.png)



## Edit or Delete Restriction Type(s)

Existing Restriction Types can be edited in the editor or can be deleted from the library.  First it is important to look through the list of existing clinical restriction types the system currently offers and simply click the Edit or Delete link on the specific clinical restriction type list view.



![](../../external_files/7bd5664fbc33c9d9012bbe8791a60b24.png)



To edit a Restriction Type (whether it be the title or option settings) for the entire system, simply click the edit link on that specific restriction type. It will open the Edit Clinical Restriction Type screen and fields.  Edit what you need to or click ‘set options' button to edit any discrete or selected values.

Remember to click Save within the options and also within this edit screen to save all work.  A successfully edited restriction type message will appear at the top of the list view.

To delete a Restriction Type entirely from the {{% system-name %}} system, simply click the delete link on that specific restriction type.  It will open the Confirm Delete screen.  Click the Confirm button to permanently remove this restriction type from the {{% system-name %}} system.

Once deletion is confirmed, it will display a successfully deleted restriction type message at the top of the list view.  The restriction type is then removed from the current existing available restriction types listing in {{% system-name %}} .
