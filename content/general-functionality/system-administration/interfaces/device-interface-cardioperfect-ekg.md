The following is referring to a Welch Allyn CardioPerfect EKG system. Contact your MIE Implementer to see if your EKG system model can be interfaced or quoted.

Within {{% system-name %}} , you may have a chart tab named *EKG* where you can see the imported EKG device results and interpretations. Contact your MIE Implementer for set up.

Within the encounter when the EKG has been ordered or the EKG section shows on an encounter, click the Load CardioPerfect button to open the connection.

You should now see two files since you have refreshed the {{% system-name %}} screen.

Select the *.tif* file then click the **Get Interpretation** button to queue the data from the Welch Allyn machine for import into the patient's chart.

To send the results to a Physician or NP for review, select the **Review** radio button so that the ECG can be over-read.

Click the **Upload** button to upload and save the data/document into the patient's chart.

The ECG data is now stored in the patient's chart.
