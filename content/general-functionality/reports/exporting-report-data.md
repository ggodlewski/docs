You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports left-side bar tab (except Tran Stats tab). Also allows users within a role to access the Statistics tab in Control.

Many of the {{% system-name %}} reports offer a hyperlink to export spreadsheet or show spreadsheet.

The functionality of this is to take the data that rendered on your screen and export it to an XML file that you can open with Excel. From the excel document, you can manipulate or sort the data further as you wish and/or save the report in an excel format or distribute as you wish.

If you open the XML file via the *export or show spreadsheet* functionality, you may have to have your XML file open settings set to default to Excel. Once you set that default, when you click to open any XML document, it will automatically display in Excel. XML file type is not usually associated/defaulted to Excel. It is usually associated by default to Internet Explorer. If you save the file and then Open Excel and then from within Excel open the file it will display. However, it's easiest to just change your default to open any XML documents to display in Excel automatically.

These are the steps on how to set Excel to be the default to open XML documents:

Generate a report using the *export or show spreadsheet* hyperlinks from a {{% system-name %}} report. Save the XML file to your desktop after you clicked *show or export spreadsheet* hyperlink. It will save the report data as an XML file type to your desktop.

Go to that report file icon on your desktop and on it, right click and select *Properties*

You have now completed and successfully changed the default of XML files to open with Excel. The properties screen should look like this where it states the type of file is XML and it will open with Excel.

The functionality of this is to take the data that rendered on your screen and export it to a CSV file type. From the CSV file, you can manipulate or sort the data further as you wish and/or save the report in an excel type spreadsheet or distribute as you wish. A CSV is a comma separated values file, which allows data to be saved in a table structured format. CSV files can be used with any spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, OpenOffice Calc, or Google Spreadsheets. You can save as a CSV file type, but most users change the file type and save it as an Excel (xls) file type when you go to save the file and select a different file type to save it as.
