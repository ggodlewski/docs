An employer organization to be added as a sub-employer organization must already be in the system and an employer organization. If it is not, first create the employer organization that will be subordinate or [change an organization to an employer organization](changing-organizations-to-employer-organizations.html).

Before persons can be added as contacts of the employer organization, their information must be in the system in contact charts. See [Adding contacts to accounts](adding-contacts-to-employer-organizations.html).

* [Find employer organizations](finding-employer-organizations.html) to ensure the employer organization to create is not already in the system. If it exists as an organization rather than an employer organization, stop here and see [Changing organizations to employer organizations](changing-organizations-to-employer-organizations.html).
