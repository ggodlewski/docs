Duplicate fee schedules to create a new fee schedule with the same fee schedule items and a different fee schedule name. 

When duplicating a fee schedule, you can also set the prices of all items in the duplicate fee schedule to be a percentage of those in the original fee schedule. The costs of items in the duplicate fee schedule can also be set to a percentage of those in the original fee schedule. This is optional.

* [Find the fee schedule](finding-fee-schedules.html) to which to duplicate or [view all fee schedules](viewing-all-fee-schedules.html).
* In the <em>Fee Schedule</em> section, in the <em>OPTIONS</em> column of the fee schedule to duplicate, select <strong>duplicate</strong>. The <em>Add New Fee Schedule</em> window appears.
* In the <em>Add New Fee Schedule</em> window, in the <em>Fee Schedule</em> Name field, enter a <strong>name for the new fee schedule</strong>.   ![](../../external_files/1a8ad7d598594e3d4248c2d6b73d81ec.png)
* In the <em>Begin Date and End Date</em> fields, modify <strong>the dates</strong> if necessary.
* In the <em>Cost Percentage</em> field, do one:
    * To not change the costs of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, do not make an entry.
    * To change the costs of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, enter a <strong>whole number or decimal number</strong> by which the costs of all items in the original fee schedule will be multiplied. For example, to double the costs of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, enter 2.
* In the <em>Price Percentage</em> field, do one:
    * To not change the prices of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, do not make an entry.
    * To change the prices of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, enter a <strong>whole number or decimal number</strong> by which the prices of all items in the original fee schedule will be multiplied. For example, to halve the prices of all items in the duplicate fee schedule, enter .5.
* Select <strong>Save</strong>. The system duplicates the fee schedule and sets costs and prices, if applicable. The fee schedule appears in the <em>Fee Schedule</em> section.
