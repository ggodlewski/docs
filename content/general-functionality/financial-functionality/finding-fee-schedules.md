Note that the system treats the dates specified in the *Begin Date* and *End Date* fields as inclusive of the effective periods of fee schedules. 

For example, if there is a fee schedule effective from the first day of this month to the last day of this month and a date next month is entered in the *End Date* field, the system will not find this fee schedule because the date is outside of that fee schedule's effective period.

* Select the side menu. The side menu appears.
* Select <strong>Control Panel</strong>. The <em>Admin</em> tab opens. 
* From the <em>Module</em> list, select <strong>Fee Schedule</strong>. The <em>Fee Schedules</em> page appears.![](../../external_files/3da450f12f068513ccdeb7f7c438a3f7.png)
* To search for fee schedules by name, in the <strong>Fee Schedule</strong> field, type some or all of the name. The system displays matching fee schedule names. Select the appropriate fee schedule name. To remove the fee schedule name, select the <strong>minus button</strong> next to it.
* To search for fee schedules by a begin date, do one:
    * Type the day, month, and year of the beginning date to search.
    * Select <strong>Calendar</strong> button to choose the day, month, and year of the beginning date to search.
    * Select <strong>Today</strong> button to choose today as the day, month, and year of the beginning date to search.
* To search for fee schedules by an end date, do one:
    * Type the day, month, and year of the end date to search.
    * Select <strong>Calendar</strong> button to choose from a calendar the day, month, and year of the end date to search.
    * Select <strong>Today</strong> button to choose today as the day, month, and year of the end date to search.
* To search by an order included in a fee schedule, in the <strong>Order</strong> field, type. The system displays matching orders. Select the appropriate order. To remove an order, select the <strong>minus button</strong> next to it.
* To include deleted fee schedules that match the search criteria in the results, select <strong>Show Deleted</strong>. 
* To search for fee schedules by some combination of begin date, end date, order included, and deleted or not deleted, make entries in the appropriate fields according to steps 4 through 8. 
* Select <strong>Search</strong>. In the <em>Fee Schedules Items</em> area, the system displays the contents of matching fee schedules. If nothing appears in the <em>Fee Schedule Items</em> area, no fee schedules matched all of the criteria.
