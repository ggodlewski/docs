When a physician uploads an encounter dictation voice file, it is entered into the system with a "Held by Dictator" status. This way it can not be grabbed or transcribed by any user until the physician is done with their encounter exam in the system. This encounter dictation file will not show in the Pending Dictation tab/list until the physician is done with their exam in the system.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image1.png)

When the physician is done with their exam, they will click the submit button or note complete button in the encounter and this will change the voice files to Pending status and automatically then puts the dictation into the Pending Dictation tab/list to be grabbed for transcription.

## Transcribing Encounter Dictation

Log into {{% system-name %}} and click on the left sidebar menu tab called DICTATION.

You will open to the MY PENDING tab of the dictation module.

This opens to the summary screen of your assigned and any unassigned dictations.

When you first locate an Encounter dictation, you will see a primary Dictation ID number.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image3.png)

Encounters are sections and allow a provider to dictate in many different sections of one encounter. Yet when the provider releases the dictations to be transcribed (by clicking the note complete button in the encounter) the dictation job shows in the Pending dictations as an individual job. The "duration" is the total duration time of all dictated sections in that encounter.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image4.png)

If you click on the underlined primary Dictation ID number, the primary dictation id number will open into one or more dictations. This will depend on how many sections of the encounter the physician dictated into. So in this example, I didn't grab the job to transcribe yet, I simply clicked the 000017 dict id number and it expands to show me the 3 dictations within this main job for this patient's encounter. It also shows me which sections/fields the provider dictated into.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image5.png)

Most transcribers won't view dictation id components of the job. They will just "grab" a job that needs transcribed.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image6.png)

{{% note %}}

Once you grab/start an encounter dictation, you MUST complete all related pending component dictations linked within that main job.

{{% /note %}}


When you have grabbed an encounter dictation to transcribe, the MIE Player with the encounter transcription text box section will open on your screen and the title of the encounter "section" the provider dictated into. This is the section your typing transcription will be going into within the patient's encounter.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image7.png)

{{% warning %}}

**NEVER** click on the red ‘x' box in the upper-right corner of the player, to close the dictation. If you click the red X box by mistake, the dictation will remain in the Pending or Incomplete tab instead of being properly closed and put in the Completed tab.

{{% /warning %}}


![](transcribing-dictation.images/image8.png)
When you are transcribing in an encounter and you can not hear the physician or if you have a question for the transcription supervisor, simply click the *Inaudible* button.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image9.png)

The word "[Inaudible]" will be automatically placed in your transcription box.

This will also help the supervisor determine where (at what point in the dictation) the transcriptionist had a question.

You can click Inaudible as many times as you need to throughout a dictation.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image10.png)

The transcriptionist should continue typing until done with the first voice file of the encounter dictation.

When done with that dictated job, you **must** click the *Done* button located under the transcription box. Do not click the RED X at the top right corner to get out.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image11.png)

Once you click *Done*, the encounter dictation player will automatically pull up/display the next dictation of that encounter exam dictated bundle. It will show the field/section of the encounter that the provider dictated into. Your typed transcription will go into that encounter section.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image12.png)

Again, you must complete it. Use the inaudible button if needed, and then click the *Done* button.

When there are no more dictations to complete in the encounter dictation bundle for that job, a new window will open that displays a message saying all dictation for the encounter are currently in progress.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image13.png)

When this box appears, you **MUST** click the underlined **Close link** to close the dictation correctly and transfer the dictation file to the appropriate tab.

Do not click the Red X box in the upper right hand corner of your screen to close out. This will not properly close the dictation and will not place it in the appropriate dictation tab. If you click the red X box by mistake, the dictation will remain in the Pending or Incomplete tab instead of being properly closed and put in the Completed tab.

{{% info %}}

If your transcription department has been given rights to archive & close encounters from here (after transcribing the dictation), you will see other options here besides Close. See other help documentation named [Encounters-Closing Dictation](closing-encounters-from-the-dictation-module.html)*.*

## Inaudible Transcriptions

If you had marked any part of the transcription with * Inaudible * then when you have closed the voice file, the file will be moved to the Incomplete dictation tab.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image14.png)

The transcriber will be able to grab the dictations that have been marked as inaudible and make any changes necessary. (See other help documentation titled EDITING ENCOUNTER TRANSCRIPTION).

Should someone other than the original transcriptionist need to grab the voice files from the Incomplete tab, the user must Edit the document and change the status to Pending. The voice files will be moved back to the Pending tab where you can *Unassign* the dictations.

## Edit Status of Dictation Jobs

Also in the encounter dictation and related dictations for the encounter, there is an edit link. This edit link for encounter dictations will only allow you to change the status of the dictation. The rest of the values from the encounter dictation table are read only.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image15.png)

Click the edit link to edit the status of the encounter dictation. Select the status change using the drop-down. Click the MODIFY button to save your status change.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image16.png)

## Transcribing Encounter Multi-Dictation

Log into {{% system-name %}} and click on the left sidebar menu tab called DICTATION.

You will open to the MY PENDING tab of the dictation module.

This opens to the summary screen of your assigned and any unassigned dictations.

When you first locate an Encounter dictation, you will see a primary Dictation ID number.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image17.png)

Encounters allow a provider to dictate using a function called "Multi-Dictation". A provider can dictate into one voice file and enable you to type the transcribed words into the specific encounter sections. When a provider dictates using the "multi-dictation" functionality, they should verbally be telling you which encounter section it should be typed into.

When you have grabbed an encounter dictation to transcribe, the MIE Player with the encounter transcription text box section will open on your screen and the title and field name will say *Multi-Field Dictation*.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image18.png)

{{% warning %}}

**NEVER** click on the red ‘x' box in the upper-right corner of the player, to close the dictation. If you click the red X box by mistake, the dictation will remain in the Pending or Incomplete tab instead of being properly closed and put in the Completed tab.

{{% /warning %}}


![](transcribing-dictation.images/image19.png)
To transcribe a multi-field dictation, you must click the *Click to Transcribe* hyperlink.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image20.png)

When you click that, the multi-dictation sections of that specific patient's encounter will open as free-text boxes to begin typing in each specific section the provider states the words need to go into. The MIE player is still open on the screen so you can play/listen to the dictation, but you will be typing in the encounter section fields directly. There may already be words or data in those sections and you can add to it based on what needs typed/transcribed.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image21.png)

The transcriptionist should continue typing in the free text sections until done with the voice file of the multi-field encounter dictation. When done with that dictated job, you **must** click the *Done* button located in the MIE Dictation player window. Do not click the RED X at the top right corner to get out.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image22.png)

The window will refresh to display a message saying all dictation for the encounter are currently in progress.

When this box appears, you **MUST** click the underlined **Close link** to close the dictation correctly and transfer the dictation job file to the appropriate tab.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image23.png)

Do not click the Red X box in the upper right hand corner of your screen to close out. This will not properly close the dictation and will not place it in the appropriate dictation tab.

*If you click the red X box by mistake, the dictation will remain in the Pending or Incomplete tab instead of being properly closed and put in the Completed tab.*

The patient's encounter with the section free-text fields will still be open on your screen. This is what you typed/transcribed from that job. You now need to click the *SAVE* button which is located at the top or at the bottom.

![](transcribing-dictation.images/image24.png)

{{% info %}}

If your transcription department has been given rights to archive & close encounters from here (after transcribing the dictation), you should see the option and archive & close encounter. See other help documentation named [Encounters-Closing Dictation](closing-encounters-from-the-dictation-module.html)*.*

Then you can go back to the Dictation sidemenu tab and grab another job to transcribe.
