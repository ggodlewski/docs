## Olympus Digital Dictation

The Olympus software has to be installed on the computer that they have the docking station hooked up to. You can do this yourself, or call our Help Desk for assistance.

**We recommend also having a SpeechMike as a backup to use for urgent or STAT or backup dictations.**

{{% note %}}

We recommend each physician have their own Olympus mike. If that is not possible and all the physicians in the practice use the same Olympus mike, then it is necessary to always do a HARD START and HARD STOP on the mike itself after each patient so it uploads into a separate files for separate patients. And switch from Dr. A to Dr. B, etc.

A pin number is not required to see all the physicians in the Physician drop-down choices.



The physician drop-down choice will display all users in the physician realm. The drop-down defaults to the logged in user. PINS are only needed for phone dictation.



If a user is logged in, it will check their security permission for dictation. If they are not logged in (phone dication usually) it will check the security of the pin.



You should double check that the users who log in to upload dictations from olympus players have permission to do so.

* <strong>Job Type</strong>: Most do not have specific job types entered since you are transferring a variety of different types of dictations.
* <strong>Location</strong>: Select the location where these dictations were done.
* <strong>Service Date</strong>: Select the date these dictations were done.

## After Transferring Olympus Dictations

![](../../../external_files/afe0ea1abae1c75cc19f25b40c985a86.png)

After uploading your transfers, you will see them listed in the Dictation pending queue of the Dictation tab.

There will not be any patient names associated with them using Olympus mics. This is why it is important to do a hard stop/hard start after each patient so they transfer over individually into individual dictated files.

You cannot edit dictation done and uploaded. You would dictate a separate note/file stating the correction, etc. You could create a separate work type for "correction" and task upon "dictation add" for that worktype, etc.
