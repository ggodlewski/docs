Log into {{% system-name %}}

Click *Scheduler* from the left sidebar menu.

If you have the preference in My Settings of FORCE DEFAULT RESOURCES set to Yes, your scheduler view will show all the resources (physicians) schedules that you have added an appt for or edited an appt for. To only show one resource, make sure this is set to No.

Click *Waiting List* tab from top menu of tabs. It will automatically show all people on the waiting list for your practice if the *Resource* in the search field is set at *Select Resource*.

It will also have resource and patient search fields at the top to narrow down a search for someone on the waiting list. This Waiting List will automatically open set to the resource & location you are defaulted to. To view the *entire* waiting list, make Resource set to *Select Resource* and location set to *Any Location* in this search.

The waiting list will always list patients in ascending order of when they were inserted on the waiting list. Meaning, the top person on the list is the first person on the waiting list. The last person on the list is the most recent person added to the waiting list.

You may want to utilize the "Appointment Report" found in the Reports module instead because it offers a lot more filter criteria and functions also.

![](../../external_files/f6c8c877afdddcbc709c4012aaf7e334.png)

There are optional fields to narrow your search from:

* <strong>Resource:</strong> If you wish to only view the waiting list for a specific physician/resource, select the resource in the <em>Resource</em> search field at the top. Leaving it as <em>Select Resource</em> will show the waiting list for the entire practice. This view (per specific resource or leaving as select resource) will list the appointments in ascending order of when they were created. Meaning, the top person on the list is the first person on the waiting list. The last person on the list is the most recent person added to the waiting list.
* <strong>Group resources:</strong> If you check-mark this and a patient is on a waiting list for multiple resources, this will make the list show all of the resources as a single item. Grouping of the resources will list all the required resources as a single item. This prevents listing the same patient multiple times when the appointment requires multiple (more than 1) resource. It also makes appointments requiring multiple resources stand out.

Example of the waiting list shown with_out_ grouping the resources. This patient below is on the waiting list for an appointment requiring multiple resources. Therefore, she is listed twice on the waiting list as each resource is separated out.

This example shows the waiting list *with* the Group resources check-marked. This groups the resources for any patient that is on the waiting list for an appointment requiring more than 1 resource. It lists the patient once, but groups all the resources (physicians) in the doctor line.

* <strong>Patient:</strong> To search for a specific patient on the waiting list, type patient's last name (in the <em>Patient</em> search field) and it will pop-up patients to select from. Highlight the patient then click <em>Search</em>. Your search will show up in the Waiting List: below. If you want to search for someone by using their MR#, you must type a question mark and then the MR#.
* <strong>Location:</strong> To search by a specific location on the waiting list, select the desired location from the drop-down arrow. Only shows inside locations. It does not show outside locations.
* <strong>Comment:</strong> To search for any specific text within a comment that would be in the comments section of the patient's waiting list appointment.
* <strong>Create Date:</strong> To search by a specific date the appointment was created in the waiting list.
* <strong>Hide Future Visible:</strong> This checkbox should only be used to display occupational health appointments with a visible date in the future.Â  These waiting list appointments have a visible date in the future when the employee is notified that they are due to schedule their appointment.

**Show CSV Link:** If you click the *Show CSV* link above the waiting list results, it will put the waiting list into an excel spreadsheet/report format. You can sort, print, save, or do other functions from this report/spreadsheet ability.
