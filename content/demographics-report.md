You must have security role access to the Reports module/tab. This setting is in the Security Role Editor and is in {{% system-name %}} controls called STATISTICS. Set to Yes or No. This allows users within a role to access the entire Reports left-side bar tab (except Tran Stats tab). Also allows users within a role to access the Statistics tab in Control.

Demographic Report shows all patient demographics by criteria for label printing or for demographic reporting purposes.

Click *Reports* tab on the left side-bar menu.

Click *Demographic Report* tab from the top tab menu.

The demographics search fields will display on the screen.

However, if the system contains a lot of patient charts, this could time out and not result anything, thus requiring a field to filter by to reduce matches.

There are some icons you can hover over that will give you some information or ways to enter fields.

Click SEARCH when you want to run your search for patient data related to demographic fields.

Your search result will display below the search fields. It will display Matching Patients according to the fields you narrowed your search down to include.
