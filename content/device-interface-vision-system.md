* Select the correct vision test for the correct patient. (Note: if the device is being kept clean your results should be the only ones listed)

* Titmus Vision Test results will populate the page on the encounter or Vision Tool chart tab.
    * Abnormal results will be highlighted.
* Scroll to bottom of encounter and choose save to ensure vision test is saved to this encounter.
* Done
