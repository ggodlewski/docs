Introduction of the Team:

Portal Usage - Need to think through the RRH portal usage. What would a peak time be for the portal. Margie asked if this is in aggregate or by location and whether this is current or future. This needs to be aggregate and EH would like RRH to consider the future planned state to ensure the encapsulated environment can handle the peak traffic times.



**Action Item** - Assigned to Jenna - Update the Prep Work Document with an item for Portal Usage - **Done**



SMEs and Super Users - Marni asked about SMEs and Super Users and the expectations for how many by location. Jenna let her know that 1-2 Super Users per location would be ideal. SMEs can be anyone who is aware of the workflows and current system set-up. She used scheduling as an example. A scheduler who has been with the company for a few years and knows all the processes. She would be the SME just for the Scheduling section. Margie brought up the Super Users may be limited for the 1 week of training. Jenna mentioned that everything will be recording and they will be preparing training documents as well. 



**Action Item** - Assigned to Marni and Margie - They will work further on the list of Super User/SMEs.



Margie requested to receive the slide deck and the recording. 



**Action Item** - Assigned to Jenna - Providing immediately - **Done **
