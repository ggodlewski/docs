## View Departments

Click *Control* on the left sidebar menu.

Click *Access Control* tab at the top tabs.

You will see an alphabetized list of the Departments that exist in your {{% system-name %}} system.

![](managing-departments.images/image1.png)

Click on the underlined *Department* name to open a list of the users that are set to this department.

## Add a Department

Click *Control* on the left sidebar menu.

Click *Access Control* tab at the top tabs.

Click *View Departments* link option at the top left.

You will see an alphabetized list of the Departments that exist in your {{% system-name %}} system. Click *Add Department* link towards the top right corner of this screen.

![](managing-departments.images/image3.png)

When you click Add Department, the Add Department screen fields will display.

![](managing-departments.images/image4.png)

**NAME**: Type is the full name of the department you wish to add.

**VIEWABLE DEPARTMENTS**: Then you must check any *Viewable Departments* that you want this department to be able to view. Make sure it's own department is check-marked. Once the department is checked, the users in that department will be able to view anything that those other users in that department(s) are allowed to view. You can check-mark *all* of the departments by clicking the **Check All Dept** button. These viewable departments are primarily if a user is set to a security permission to view restricted departments only. For example, suppose I am an administrator (as my primary department) and my viewable departments are physicians and nurses, but not pharmacists. Then I cannot see anyone whose primary department is "pharmacists". If the physicians department can view nurses, pharmacists and administrators, then a person whose primary department is "physicians" can view any pharmacist. If, as a primary administrator, I am also in the physicians department, I still cannot view anyone in the pharmacy department. If a dept is marked viewable, the user can see the other users within that department. *Currently this is for NoMoreClipboard use only, however any |system| user may be set to be restricted to view specific department(s) only.*

Then click *Submit Dept.* It will then say it was successfully loaded.

## Delete/Inactivate a Department

Click *Control* on the left sidebar menu.

Click *Access Control* tab at the top tabs.

![](managing-departments.images/image6.png)

When you *delete* a department, it does not actually delete it. It marks it as "inactive".

It will ask you a confirmation that you really want to delete this department. Click Delete to proceed or cancel to escape and get out.

## Reactivating a Deleted Department

If you â€˜deleted' a department (inactivated a department), and you need to put it back in as an active department, you click the *Show Inactive* link in the section title. This will display all active and deleted (inactive) departments in an alphabetized listing on the screen.

![](managing-departments.images/image8.png)

Find the department you want to re-activate and click *Activate* in the options column.

If you need a department completely and permanently deleted, you need to call MIE to have that done.

You will now be in the Edit Department screen fields.

**NAME**: You can change the name of the department by typing in a new name or correction, etc.

**VIEWABLE DEPARTMENTS**: You can edit by check-marking (or un-checkmarking) any *Viewable Departments* that you want this department to be able to view. Make sure it's own department is check-marked. Once the department is checked, the users in that department will be able to view anything that those other users in that department(s) are allowed to view. You can check-mark *all* of the departments by clicking the **Check All Dept** button. These viewable departments are primarily if a user is set to a security permission to view restricted departments only. Currently this is for NoMoreClipboard use only, however any {{% system-name %}} user may be set to be restricted to view specific department(s) only.
