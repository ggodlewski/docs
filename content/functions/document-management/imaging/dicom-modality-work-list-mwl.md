In most cases, once MWL is installed and configured on the base system, configuring MWL for a DICOM entity is as simple as checking a box.

1. Navigate to the DICOM sidemenu, and click the <strong>View Application Entities</strong> link in the upper-right corner.

2. Once the list of configured entities has loaded, click <strong>Edit</strong> on the entity you wish to configure for MWL.

3. When the Application Entity editor opens, checkmark the <strong>Allow MWL Query</strong> option and click the <strong>Submit Changes</strong> button. This option gives the configured device the ability to send MWL queries to the server and receive orders based upon the query criteria. ![](dicom-modality-work-list-mwl.images/image3.png) 

This is all that is required to enable MWL on a configured DICOM entity, so long as the device supports standard MWL protocol.

## MWL Configuration

The MWL configuration requires the installation of the dicomd_mwl application.Â
