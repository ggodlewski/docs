The {{% system-name %}} system can efficiently scan and index the paper charts a practice currently has, as well as paper reports that most medical practices continue to receive. Further, {{% system-name %}} facilitates the reception of digital documents sent via HL7 interfaces, or using such standards as LOINC. The AlternaTIFF ActiveX Control and MIEScanner Plug-in must to be installed in order for WebScan, as well as for other features, to function properly.

## Installing Components

When working with WebScan, users may be prompted to install *alttiff.cab* and *scancontrol.cab*, the cabinet files for the ActiveX control and MIEScanner plug-in. Both of these are needed for the WebScan program and other modules within the {{% system-name %}} system.

These instructions are for users on a Windows 10 operating system. Users must have Administrator privileges to install ActiveX Controls.
