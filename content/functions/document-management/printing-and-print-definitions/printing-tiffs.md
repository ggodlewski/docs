6. Once at this screen, Enter Date of Study, Document type, Referring Physician name, Patient name and Service Location. These fields are auto complete fields, so it is not necessary to type the entire data in.

11. The user may browse away from this screen, or toggle back to another application (sleep software or Pacemaker software).

It is ok to browse, simply click "OK" to proceed.
