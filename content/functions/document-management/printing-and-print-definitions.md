New databases are preloaded with a standard set of print definitions. Print definitions provide ways to group many documents, forms, layouts, or the like into a defined print or fax job. Print definitions can also be attached to any appointment type, which allows users to click one button and get a group of forms/documents for use, as it relates to a scheduled appointment. These print definitions can be edited or deleted, as needed, depending on client needs.
