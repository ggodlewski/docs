Notice that the Auto-Assign button is pressed in. Now click on the "Browse" icon. The *browse* icon is the icon that looks like a yellow folder w/ a magnifying glass on it. It is to the right of *Assigned Application* field.

Now you need to assign a Keyboard Input command. For example hold the Alt key down with U.

Make sure this combination doesn't already exist in your program.

Internet explorer is already using Alt + F, Alt + E, Alt + V, Alt + T, Alt + H.

The "Dictation" layout or any other layout used here, needs to have the access keys assigned to the buttons for uploading a dictation. When done, click the *close* button.

When done, click on **File** from the top toolbar, then click **Save**.

After you click Save, it will pop open a SAVE AS screen in the Driver Utility.

Type in the *File name* field **Webchart.scm** to save as **Webchart.scm**.

Make sure *Save as type* says Scheme files (.SCM) and click SAVE.
