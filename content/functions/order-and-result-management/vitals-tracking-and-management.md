Vital signs not only assist in early detection of potential problems, they aid in the monitoring and maintenance of ongoing medical conditions. The Vital Signs layout allows {{% system-name %}} users to view and add measurements of a patient's essential body functions. Whether it is from within the Vitals chart tab or within the patient's encounter, the body's most basic functions can be measured and recorded, quickly and easily.

## Adding Vitals to the Patient Encounter

1. To add vitals to a patient's encounter, navigate to the <strong>Objective</strong> section of the encounter, open the <strong>Vitals</strong> subsection, and click the pencil ![](vitals-tracking-and-management.images/image1.png) icon, located on the right of the header. The Vitals section will expand. Note that previous vitals display at the bottom of the Vitals section.

2. With the Vitals section expanded, simply fill in the appropriate fields and use the dropdowns, adding comments, if necessary.
3. The observation <strong>Date/Time</strong> will automatically populate today's date. If the information needs changed or made current, utilize the appropriate buttons, located to the right of the entry fields or free text.

4. When entering measurements, any blood pressure, respiratory, pulse, or temperature values falling out of range will produce an on-screen alert, giving the choice to modify.



![](vitals-tracking-and-management.images/image3.png)



5. Additionally, if BMI falls outside of a healthy range, the system will automatically prompt for a need of patient education and a potential Dietary Consultation. Clicking <strong>OK</strong> will allow the system to add the order to the visit encounter automatically.

When adding Height values, {{% system-name %}} will automatically convert into inches, when feet and inches are entered with at least a prime mark (5'5 will convert to 65 inches), after tabbing to the next field.

2. Below the table of previously observed vitals are entry fields for the manual entry of new, or current, vitals.



![](vitals-tracking-and-management.images/image7.png)



3. Add all of the appropriate vitals, as needed, and note the <strong>Observation Date/Time</strong>. The system defaults the current date and time the Vital Signs chart tab was accessed.



![](vitals-tracking-and-management.images/image8.png)



4. Enter the appropriate free-text values for each measurement, using the dropdown selector to determine the unit of measurement. Comments may be made for each vital, if necessary. Use the tab key to move between fields quickly and easily.

5. Continue entering all necessary vitals. All fields DO NOT need entered in order to continue.
6. When entering measurements, any blood pressure, respiratory, pulse, or temperature values falling out of range will produce an on-screen alert, giving the choice to modify.



![](vitals-tracking-and-management.images/image10.png)



7. Once all the necessary values have been entered, click the ![](vitals-tracking-and-management.images/image11.png) button.
