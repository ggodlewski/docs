With the {{% system-name %}} Dynamic Encounter, data is easily captured at the time of the visit, allowing clinical staff and providers to streamline all necessary clinic operations.

## 

[Injury Care](injury-care.md):

{{% system-name %}} can be used for treating, documenting, managing, *and* reporting injuries and illnesses, which can be initiated from a visit to the clinic, or in advance, via an employee portal. This allows incidents to be reported anytime, day or night. And regardless of how the information is captured, {{% system-name %}} can compile the recorded data into form overlays, minimizing the need for redundant data entry, while also easing reporting burdens.

## 

[Dictation & Transcription](dictation-and-transcription.md):

{{% system-name %}} has seamlessly integrated dictation into the workflow to provide the clinician a variety of input methods. As important as dictation is to the daily workflow of the physician, it is equally important to have a streamlined process to have those dictation files converted to text. {{% system-name %}} also includes a robust transcription module for this reason.
